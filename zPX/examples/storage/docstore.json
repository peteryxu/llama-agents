BUSINESS\n      Overview\n      Uber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and\nproduct expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on\nour platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). We connect consumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for\nridesharing services, and connect Riders and other consumers (\u201cEater(s)\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery\nservice providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or\n\u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We use\nthis same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.\n      Our technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the\nMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).\n      Our Segments\n      As of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offerings\neach address large, fragmented markets.\n      Mobility\n      Mobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,\nminibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.\n      We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharing\ncategory position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates of\ntotal ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in a\ngiven region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publicly\navailable information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of\nthe world where we operate. We also participate in certain regions through our minority-owned affiliates. At the time of entering into such transactions, we\nbelieved based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leading\nridesharing category position in its respective market.\n      Delivery\n      Our Delivery offering allows consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal\ndelivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launched\nour Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Delivery\nenables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expands\nthe pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on our\nplatform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we\nbelieve generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-\nhouse expenses.\n      During 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. The\nacquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. We also completed the acquisition of The Drizly\nGroup, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), allowing us to expand alcohol offerings in our Delivery business with Drizly\u2019s leading platform, technology, scale, and expertise. The\nacquisition of Drizly has been accounted for as a business combination.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing\nindustries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industry\nis highly fragmented and deeply inefficient. It can take several hours, sometimes days, for shippers to find a truck and driver for shipments, with most of the\nprocess conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It is\nequally difficult for carriers to find and book the shipments that work for their businesses, spending hours on the phone negotiating pricing and terms. These\ninefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,\n\n\n                                                                                                         4", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4302, "end_char_idx": 6087, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "384aa04c-a216-4234-ac17-35fe33d69572": {"__data__": {"id_": "384aa04c-a216-4234-ac17-35fe33d69572", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49ffc1f3-903f-461d-93f1-9abb0f8c67f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0cd22a75e54782f6a9949eca85cd1ea4cbb2a1e80047f31c08085fff2c9564f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "82188188-0fe8-417f-b881-8a5a25a5906e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "80659419a0826a76763f3d77b250dbec8ab5b09935343ba2331a91c5c264d56e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "which are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automate\nand accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing\nand the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.\n      We serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks,\nsecure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors represent\nsignificant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.\n      During 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.

Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,\nDelivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to our\nplatform. Additionally, for the three months ended December 31, 2021, consumers who used both Mobility and Delivery generated 12.6 Trips per month on\naverage, compared to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering in cities where both Mobility and Delivery were offered. We\nbelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.\n      With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the United\nStates as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priority\nservice, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available in\nselect cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for our\nconsumers. We exited 2021 with over 6 million members for our Uber One, Uber Pass, Eats Pass and Rides Pass membership programs. In 2020, we rolled out our\n\u201cSuper App\u201d view on iOS and Android, which combines our multiple offerings into a single app and is designed to remove friction for our consumers.\n      We are also utilizing our data and scale to offer marketplace-centric advertising to connect merchants and brands with our platform network and unlocking\ncross-platform advertising formats. During the fourth quarter of 2021, active advertising merchants grew to over 170,000.\n      Competitive Environment\n      We compete on a global basis in highly fragmented markets.

As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional\ncompetition. While we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on\na limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner\nthan we do. The competition we face in each of our offerings includes:\n      \u2022     Mobility. Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the markets\n            that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In addition,\n            public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in many cities.\n            We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, including Lyft, Ola, Didi,\n            Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\n      \u2022     Delivery. Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for drivers,\n            consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon. Our\n            Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, meal kit delivery services, grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\n      \u2022     Freight. Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H. Robinson, Total Quality Logistics, XPO Logistics,\n            Convoy, Echo Global Logistics, Coyote, Transfix, DHL, and NEXT Trucking.\n      Government Regulation\n      We operate in a particularly complex legal and regulatory environment. Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,\nand regulations, including those related to Internet activities, privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, intellectual property, competition, consumer protection,\npayments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations are\nconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations we\nare subject to are described below.\n      Mobility\n      Our platform, and in particular our Mobility products, are subject to differing, and sometimes conflicting, laws, rules, and regulations in the numerous\njurisdictions in which we operate. A large number of proposals are before various national, regional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both\nwithin the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.\n      In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,\nincluding licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,\nand regulations while other jurisdictions have not adopted any laws, rules, and regulations which govern our Mobility business. Further, certain jurisdictions,\nincluding Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, and\nregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates\nsignificant complexities for our business and operating model.\n      Substantially all states in the United States and numerous municipalities in the United States and around the world have adopted Transportation Network\nCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations. These regulations generally focus on companies that operate websites or mobile apps that connect individual drivers with their own\nvehicles to passengers willing to pay to be driven to their destinations. These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,\nbackground checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.\n      In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s Assembly\nBill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020, codified a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law.

In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state\nballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work.

Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,\n            could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate\n            in Mexico City.\n      \u2022     In January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times\n            before riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\n      \u2022     In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap\n            on the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard for\n            time and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by\n            Drivers on our platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on\n            our platform that went into effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would\n            implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.

This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment creates significant\ncomplexities for our business and operating model.\n      As we continue to expand our offerings, we may be subject to additional regulations separate from those that apply to our Mobility products.\n      Data Privacy and Protection\n      Our technology platform, and the user data we collect and process to run our business, are an integral part of our business model and, as a result, our\ncompliance with laws dealing with the collection and processing of personal data is core to our strategy to improve platform user experience and build trust.\nRegulators around the world have adopted or proposed requirements regarding the collection, use, transfer, security, storage, destruction, and other processing of\npersonally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals, and these laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines, and other penalties. Two\nexamples of such regulations that have significant implications for our business are the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), a law\nwhich went into effect in May 2018 and implemented more stringent requirements for processing personal data relating to individuals in the EU, and the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect in January 2020 and established new consumer rights and data privacy and protection requirements\nfor covered businesses.

In 2021, the ever-evolving COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on our employees and our\nworkforce management strategy and caused us to continually adapt how we work.

Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new\ndynamics into the households of many of our employees.

We believe that employees who have opportunities for development are more engaged, satisfied, and productive.\nEmployees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uber\nthrough internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enable\nthem to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promote\nwellness and productivity. This helps our diverse employee base manage life\u2019s expected and unexpected events. Globally, Uber offers competitive benefits\npackages to our employees and their families. We provide competitive benefits as well as offerings tailored to our unique populations.\n      For additional discussion, see the risk factor titled \u201c\u2014Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future\nattrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as our\n2021 People and Culture Report, which is available on our website. The information in the 2021 People and Culture report is not a part of this Form 10-K.\n      Diversity and Inclusion\n      We believe that great minds don\u2019t think alike, and we work hard to ensure that people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome and valued. We encourage\ndifferent opinions and approaches to be heard, and then we come together and build. We believe that when employees feel empowered to succeed in a work\nenvironment that celebrates, supports, and invests in diversity, progress follows. To achieve our objective to increase diversity in who we hire, we implement\nprocesses throughout Uber and measure progress. For example, the Mansfield Rule was implemented by June 2021, to ensure that we have considered women,\nLGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and racially underrepresented talent by requiring that a certain percentage of candidates considered for leadership\nroles come from historically underrepresented groups.\n      Our Board of Directors recognizes the strategic importance of these issues and incorporated employee diversity performance metrics into the compensation\npackages of our most senior executives.\n      We encourage employees who believe they, or any other employee, have been subjected to discrimination to notify their manager, Uber\u2019s People Team or the\nIntegrity Helpline.\n      As a company that powers movement, it is our goal to ensure that everyone can move freely and safely, whether physically, economically, or socially. To do\nthat, we strive to help fight the racism that persists across society, be a champion for equity, and create opportunities for all, both inside and outside our company.\nIn July 2020, we announced 14 commitments to becoming a more anti-racist company and since then, we have taken action to move these commitments forward.\nSome of our commitments to anti-racism include:\n      \u2022     Ridding our platform of racism\n      \u2022     Fighting racism with technology\n      \u2022     Sustaining equity and belonging for all\n      \u2022     Driving equity in the community\n      For more information regarding our Diversity and Inclusion efforts, please see our 2021 People and Culture Report and our 2021 ESG Report, which are\navailable on our website.

A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,\ntraditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain available\nto anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.\n      Accessible, flexible, independent work has offered an option for many workers historically marginalized from the labor market and has enabled wide\ngeographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using an\napp to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generally\npatchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker is\neither an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. At\nUber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovative\nways to address these issues.\n      \u2022    Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all work\n           should be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and other\n           app based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples of\n           our advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\n                  \u25e6     In the United States, European Union, and Canada, we put forward proposals to improve the quality of independent work, calling on\n                        policymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having access\n                        to protections and benefits doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\n                  \u25e6     In California, we welcomed the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements for platform companies like Uber to provide\n                        benefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\n                  \u25e6     In the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant to\n                        this change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paid\n                        holiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an even\n                        stronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\n      \u2022    Protections and benefits: We partner with leading insurance companies around the world to pioneer protections for independent workers, including\n           implementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\n      \u2022    Earnings: We are continually developing new technology that Drivers can use to acquire information that may help them save on costs and make\n           informed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\n      \u2022    Progression: We have partnered with Arizona State University to offer eligible Drivers and their family members access to over 100 undergraduate\n           degree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over\n           4,000 Drivers and their family members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.\n      \u2022    Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform. We believe that\n           the best ideas can come from anywhere, both inside and outside our company. In locations around the world, we are piloting innovative ways for Drivers\n           to participate in meaningful dialogue with us.

We expect our operating expenses to increase\n            significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\n      \u2022     If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other\n            factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\n      \u2022     Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and\n            negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to\n            maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n      \u2022     Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these\n            challenges may not be successful.\n      \u2022     If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be\n            adversely affected.\n      \u2022     Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may\n            harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.\n      \u2022     We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future.

Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus,\nvarious governments around the world have implemented, lifted, and in some regions reinstated travel restrictions, business restrictions, school closures,\nlimitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have,                     and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for\nexample, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions are being lifted and\nmany regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility offering may not recover\nto pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been\nand may continue to be impacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict when Driver supply levels will return to pre-pandemic\nlevels. Additionally, the recent surge of COVID-19 primarily related to the rise of the Omicron variant in many markets in the United States and globally has\naffected and may continue to affect, among other things, travel and result in other COVID-19 related advisories and restrictions and may adversely affect both\nDriver supply and consumer demand for our Mobility offering. In addition, certain U.S. jurisdictions have issued emergency orders that require us to cap\n\n\n                                                                                                         12", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 5695, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18da7eb2-0f30-48c6-819b-08100ce81ef0": {"__data__": {"id_": "18da7eb2-0f30-48c6-819b-08100ce81ef0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f726a964-ba8f-44d9-8977-465cb718409f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f2ca4fac8c889dad0ac4baf7ccce88e40ffd3186dfc053374e67c8b2e0bc7420", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c6bdfdd-91fa-43a9-8412-cc63143001fb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ba59fd1f1fdbb3fa9912787ee19a2ef762fe6f3b482f41215aaea62e2ecdd13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "fees charged to merchants on Delivery.

We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\n      In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or\n\n\n                                                                                                         13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4507, "end_char_idx": 6977, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3237e27-a7da-4c4a-ade5-e6699ed0eab9": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3237e27-a7da-4c4a-ade5-e6699ed0eab9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee4e75be-4f5a-4115-8ca7-6ad7b343c37e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e9e44a24e1ba7385dbcf5bb8f4bbfd49ef18220e5bc23d800967cec095a5e24a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f35ee00-3f4d-4cc6-94c8-8c31ec6d73d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f4a95b099381736059b0478951b14463f51d384cb28068981741504dcb1ee51b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of\nthese Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such\nproceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our\nbusiness and financial condition.\n      Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California Attorney\nGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are\nmisclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. In\nAugust 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during\nthe pendency of the lawsuit, and while the California Court of Appeal subsequently affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, on April 12, 2021, the parties filed a\nstipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.\n      In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.\n      We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,\nalleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we\nmay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial\ndecisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses\nassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social\nsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional\ncosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not have\nadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority\nof the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently\nhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n      Another example of a recent judicial decision relating to Driver classification is the Aslam, Farrar, Hoy and Mithu v. Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the\nEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather\nthan self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, going\nforward.

For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union.

If we are unable to compete effectively in these\nindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\n      Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are\nhighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and\nCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers\nto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to\nshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other\nmerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of\norders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\n      Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on\na limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner\nthan we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional\ncompetition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and\ncarriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products.

Our Mobility offering competes with personal vehicle ownership and usage, which accounts for the majority of passenger miles in the\n                markets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. In\n                addition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option in\n                many cities.

Our Delivery offering competes with numerous companies in the meal, grocery and other delivery space in various regions for Drivers,\n                consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.\n                Our Delivery offering also competes with restaurants, including those that offer their own delivery and/or take-away, meal kit delivery services,\n                grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\n         \u2022      Freight.Our Freight offering competes with global and North American freight brokers such as C.H.

If Drivers choose not to offer their services through our platform, or\nelect to offer them through a competitor\u2019s platform, we may lack a sufficient supply of Drivers to attract consumers and merchants to our platform.

To the extent that we experience Driver supply constraints in a given\nmarket, we may need to increase or may not be able to reduce the Driver incentives that we offer without adversely affecting the liquidity network effect that we\nexperience in that market.

A significant amount of our Delivery Gross Bookings come from a limited number of large restaurant\ngroups and other merchants, and this concentration increases the risk of fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to any material adverse\ndevelopments experienced by our significant restaurant partners. If platform users choose to use other ridesharing, meal delivery, or logistics services, we may lack\nsufficient opportunities for Drivers to earn a fare, carriers to book a shipment, or restaurants to provide a meal, which may reduce the perceived utility of our\nplatform. An insufficient supply of platform users would decrease our network liquidity and adversely affect our revenue and financial results.

Continued Driver dissatisfaction may also result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our\nnetwork liquidity, and which in turn may cause a further decline in platform usage.\n\n\n                                                                                                          17", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4449, "end_char_idx": 7358, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a666e0d-f3e0-4da1-a568-972f74e81cfe": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a666e0d-f3e0-4da1-a568-972f74e81cfe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6670fd74-879f-448a-884e-a43556e5c9da", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "361f41d4342d6599c1a852dc9208eff4fc0b2b86f881ae94bbdcc4ee21f7baa4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f9ab4b52-58a9-422c-92c2-f68dcc7246d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e4ac91a11fafc59891d37b161879f57995c55fb45f95a55e869568d89345b0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Any decline in the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers using our platform would reduce the value of our network and would harm our\nfuture operating results.\n      In addition, changes in Driver qualification and background-check requirements may increase our costs and reduce our ability to onboard additional Drivers to\nour platform. Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,\nprosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to make\ndeliveries through Delivery, our qualification and background check standards are generally less extensive than the standards for Drivers who are eligible to\nprovide rides through our Mobility products. Legislators and regulators may pass laws or adopt regulations in the future requiring Drivers to undergo a materially\ndifferent type of qualification, screening, or background check process, or that limit our ability to access information used in the background check process in an\nefficient manner, which could be costly and time-consuming. Required changes in the qualification, screening, and background check process (including any\nchanges to such processes of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies) could also reduce the number of Drivers in those markets or extend the time\nrequired to recruit new Drivers to our platform, which would adversely impact our business and growth. Furthermore, we rely on a single background-check\nprovider in certain jurisdictions, and we may not be able to arrange for adequate background checks from a different provider on commercially reasonable terms or\nat all. The failure of this provider to provide background checks on a timely basis would result in our inability to onboard new Drivers or retain existing Drivers\nundergoing periodic background checks that are required to continue using our platform.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We have previously received significant media coverage and\nnegative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain\nor enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.\n      Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the\nengagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse\nplatform user sentiment.\n      We have previously received a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which has adversely affected our brand and reputation and fueled\ndistrust of our company. Previous negative publicity, particularly as a result of cultural issues in 2017, adversely affected our brand and reputation, which made it\ndifficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory\nscrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. Concurrently with and after these events, our competitors raised additional capital,\nincreased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\n      In 2019, we released a safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have\noccurred on our platform in the United States. The continuing public responses to this safety report or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue\nto result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further\nunfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and\nbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could\nhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and\nCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm\nto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\n      Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control.

Our prior failure to prioritize compliance, has led to increased regulatory scrutiny\nglobally.

Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these efforts\nmay not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated or\nmanaged to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, such\nreorganizations may not be successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.\nOur workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If we\nare unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and future\nprospects will be adversely affected.\n      Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally.

We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect\nour operating results.\n      As our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 29,300 global employees as of\nDecember 31, 2021, of whom approximately 12,300 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the\nUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,\nincluding engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new\nhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our\nexisting employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in\nworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions\nin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in\nworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult\nfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly\nmanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could\nlikewise harm our business.\n      Our failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow\nresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers.

than operate in those markets independently. Our growth strategy\nhas also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our\ncompetitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, Zomato and Aurora.\n      Our ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control.

To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could\nadversely impact our financial results.

These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.\nFor Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and\ntypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain\ncities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our\nrevenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal\nfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of\nDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficult\nto detect. We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends may develop or these existing\nseasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results may\nfluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability to\nexpand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pace\nwith technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm to our brand or\nreputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In December 2018, New York City implemented a per-mile and per-minute\nminimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided by\nDrivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financial\nperformance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing\ntrips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle have\npassed, or may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing\nservices on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is\nsmaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating\nsuburban and rural areas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total\naddressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\n      In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and\nfrom airports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related\nMobility and reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by\nmandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned\nridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the\nrequisite permits.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5103, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bd4e920-30d4-440c-a43c-d8392d894adf": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bd4e920-30d4-440c-a43c-d8392d894adf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6493a87b-d6a4-412d-8e1f-dceb72f26c6f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "79b2a53bb46d37841b2245180feb215f6a2fac36e39578eebe837f2f3adf20e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0570cde-049f-4f03-8204-b4c182c06a8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ae954ef6d6c7980fb2086f77cc7db15f1dfa65ade9c355914ad943ecf48cafc2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports.

Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against\nus or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our\noperations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-\nimposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we\nhave entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport\nboundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar\nagreements with airports in all jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such\ntechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-\nautonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\n      We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our\nplatform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment\nin the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-\ndriving vehicles on our ridesharing\n\n\n                                                                                                        24", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4086, "end_char_idx": 7128, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13123f51-334e-4afb-baab-2e127d29ae60": {"__data__": {"id_": "13123f51-334e-4afb-baab-2e127d29ae60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "98908315-0c18-4a28-bdbe-c3512f5606b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5deeb429ba5710f44adc86878ad078b72396ee8e95fe7e2ccd5e2c88a5bbda20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a88701e-854a-4aef-83f2-812ef157c3cd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e73015430edcb029da6e697ffd5553e9a3d1f99af9ac6a2089c21ed022ad40a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "network. We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomous\nvehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has\nacquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that\nthey will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries. Waymo has already introduced a commercialized\nridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offer\nautonomous vehicles on our platform through our commercial agreement with Aurora or other partners. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous\nvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of parties\nwith which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which\nwould adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providing\nridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available to\nconsumers on our platform. If a significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial performance and prospects\nwould be adversely impacted.\n      Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle\ntechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability\nfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,\nand operating results.\n      Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. These\nregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,\nwe may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner to\noffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could\nbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could\nadversely affect our business.\n      Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high\ndemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and\nworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.\nOur employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,\nwhich includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamic\nnature of the pandemic. A hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining our corporate culture, increasing attrition or limiting our ability to\nattract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office, or if there are instances of COVID-19 at the office. Prolonged remote\nwork, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance\nand feelings of stress and social isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or\nadditional negative publicity could lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\n      Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior\nmanagement or other employee turnover.

Some of the factors that have an impact on\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost\nalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use\none of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public\ntransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity\nand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the\nmerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases\nfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at\nmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products\nand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or\nalternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\n      Factors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used\nvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.\nSimilarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may\nincrease merchant operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs are\nbeyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to\nseek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely\ncause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipments\non our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, or carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity,\nwhich could harm our business and operating results.\nIf we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary\nor confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.\n      We collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 license\nnumbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information.

For\nexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about\nrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further\nstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\n      Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features\ndepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any such\nnew or upgraded products, offerings, or features may not work as intended or may not provide intended value to platform users.

This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in which Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our\ntechnology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for\nridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significant\nfines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of\ncash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or\nfatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while\nusing our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could\nadversely impact our business.\n      In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and may\ncontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit the\ncash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are not\nalways effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and we\ncannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect to\na variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systems\nfail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Such\ncollection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,\nimpact our financial performance.\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n      In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly\nlimit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry\n(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed\nby the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and other\nnetwork operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card\nnetwork rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may\nreveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard. If an audit, self- assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any\ndeficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,\neven if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new\noperating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to\nviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive\nincentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business.

If we prevail in the proceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting\nthe payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to pay interest.\n      Additionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for\nvaluing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future\nincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state tax authorities, as well as foreign tax authorities, and\ncurrently face numerous audits in the United States and abroad. Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financial\nposition and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by\nour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ from\nthe amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Our\ntax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,\nwhich could impact our financial position. In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing\nlicenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our\nlicenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain\njurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial\nstatements, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\n      We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in\n2020, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and regulations promulgated in connection therewith remain\nunclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and incremental implementing\nregulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In\naddition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable\nincome as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.\n      We are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on our\nbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liability\nthat we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rates\nwhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance. We are subject to potential\nchanges in relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. We could\nbecome subject to digital services taxes in one or more jurisdictions where we operate.

If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January\n1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,\nwe also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $10.6 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating loss\ncarryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation\nundergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s\nability to use its pre-change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its\npost-change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership change. We may experience\nownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-\nownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to limitations, which\ncould potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\n\n\n                                                                                                          33", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4426, "end_char_idx": 7358, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36a1cbc6-b4f8-4740-8815-69c539da9fea": {"__data__": {"id_": "36a1cbc6-b4f8-4740-8815-69c539da9fea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0a1e307c-398e-4397-bc31-d33bc65b7110", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b211282fb2f8da5f4a2721b14d4422af96358eab2aa517ea06881d73eee98bbd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a0b9b5fd-5b8e-453a-8552-389e7b3d4d43", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c76bc171b19ae191a78ccc339c7fa45811ceb552247538438f5efae4cd03f9bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\n      Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated\nfinancial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect\nour overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity\nmay not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have\nlimited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses\nwe acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\n      As part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest\nportions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates,\nDrizly and Transplace. Competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies, and assets is intense. As such, even if we are able to identify a\ntarget for acquisition, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to receive approval from the\napplicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.\n      Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.\nWe may expend significant cash or incur substantial debt to finance such acquisitions, and such indebtedness may restrict our business or require the use of\navailable cash to make interest and principal payments. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluate\nand execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions successfully or fail to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition, and\noperating results may be harmed.\n      In addition, any businesses we acquire may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and\ntechnologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results and\nexpansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies\nregarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and\ndoing so may cause our relationships with government authorities in certain jurisdictions to suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing\nsignificant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis.

In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements\nor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-\ngoing basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201d\nincluding with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates\nCourt granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions\n(which we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Any\ninability to operate in markets such as London, as well as publicity concerning adverse judicial or licensing decisions, would adversely affect our business,\nrevenue, and operating results. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or legislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other\nauthorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, Mexico\nCity\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operational requirements, including a\nprohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC data sharing requirement and a\nrequirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,\nwe have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and our\nfailure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.\n      Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.

In\nAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruising\ncap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.\nAlthough such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, in\nNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effect\non January 1, 2020.

In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease\noperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our\nbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who\nused the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal\nchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our\nfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled\nthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in\ncertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this\npractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our\nlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future\ncontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decision\nas a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers\u2019 defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars.\nFurthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could\nadversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, that\nhave favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehicle\ncertifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge\npricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate in\naccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required to\ncomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.\n      As of December 31, 2021, our platform is available in approximately 10,500 cities across approximately 72 countries. We are subject to differing, and\nsometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,\nregional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business\nmodel.

We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\nadopted.\n      Further, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-\nmarket in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations that\nlimit or block our ability to offer our products to Drivers and consumers in those jurisdictions, thereby impeding overall use of our platform. We are actively\nchallenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing\nservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curb\nair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including the\ninstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect\nin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition\nto electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to\nhave been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations in Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us\nto share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to provide. Our failure to share such data in accordance\nwith these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt on\neither a temporary or indefinite basis.\n      Additionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly\n\n\n                                                                                                          36", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4181, "end_char_idx": 7289, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01df5fed-0b47-4b6e-bb49-966e48bef528": {"__data__": {"id_": "01df5fed-0b47-4b6e-bb49-966e48bef528", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "50d27562-8aeb-4f06-becc-6ac7e6b240c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f24c25d4fe1f7fbc031abf3ec351f91c1c407777c960d902796d0e5f1b52e36e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e5a2263-a77d-433c-bda3-d928a45fb9a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e70c40172f0ead1974e9de5f17e42cd9c2f61b6c9fabbf1ba6865537863177bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "referred to as Brexit. The UK represented approximately 8.3% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings in 2021.\n      In addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest\nthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform\nusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related\nto, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product\nliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme\nCourt of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions\nof Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.\nThese legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in\nfinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which\ncould harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,\nrevenue, and operating results.\n      In addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to\ndockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other\nMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The\noccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative\npublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\n      Competition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws. An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims\nof anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are\ntoo high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on\nour business, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse\npublicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\n      In addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make,\nimpose significant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations,\nincluding limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.

This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money\nremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We\ncontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support\nthe future growth of our business.

In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed as\na payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may block payments to\nDrivers, merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantial\ndelay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\n      Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to\nStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate\neach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our\nplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our\nplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,\nand prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not\ncompleting all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services\nreceived by those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from\nconsumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\n      In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment\nprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all. For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined\nwith changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments\nregulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money\nlaundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business. Effective\nJuly 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by the\nEuropean payments regulations.\n      In addition, as we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money\ntransmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds\ntransfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export\nrestrictions. Our business operations, including our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations.\nHistorical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets,\nor other enforcement actions. Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on\nour ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.\n      Further, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services,\nand payments to sanctioned parties.

In April 2018, we entered into a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and\nthe 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC Commissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December\n2018, U.K., Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million related to the 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and may\ncontinue to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material\nfines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued a\nproposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US Safety\nReport.

If any of these matters are resolved adversely to us, we may be subject to additional fines, penalties, and other sanctions, and could be forced to\nchange our business practices substantially in the relevant jurisdictions. Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional\nreputational harm, and could result in or complicate other inquiries, investigations, or lawsuits from other regulators in future merger control or conduct\ninvestigations.

Such\nviolations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory\nentities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Our data security and privacy practices have been the\nsubject of inquiries from government agencies and regulators, not all of which are finally resolved. In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant\nto which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how we\nprotect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities,\nfuture failure to report security incidents. In November and December 2018, U.K., Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately\n$1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. In January 2016, we entered into a settlement with the\nOffice of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices. In September 2018, we entered into stipulated\njudgments with the state attorneys general of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia relating to the 2016 Breach, which involved payment of $148 million\nand assurances that we would enhance our data security and privacy practices. Failure to comply with these and other orders could result in substantial fines,\nenforcement actions, injunctive relief, and other penalties that may be costly or that may impact our business. We may also assume liabilities for breaches\nexperienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory\nauthorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January\n14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breach\nthat Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements.

We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have received\nheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on the\nadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.\nIf we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer\npersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirement\nfor obtaining or maintaining a license or otherwise, from law enforcement agencies, and from intelligence agencies. This disclosure may result in a failure or\nperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us in\nthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand.

We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,\nand ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictions\nto suffer, and may result in such government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a\ntemporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computation\nsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the manner\nin which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.\n      Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus\ncompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,\ndisclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceived\nfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by\nindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if\nfound liable, significant damages.

We are subject to the FCPA\nand other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments, their officials, and political parties\nfor the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to\nadditional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties. Our activities in certain countries with high levels of\ncorruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers or carriers, employees, consultants, or\nbusiness partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our\nacquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem\u2019s platform and Careem\u2019s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be\nfamiliar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws. In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and\ncompliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held\nresponsible.

However, numerous jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific\nregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be\nlicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers\nmay adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of\nlicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations\nthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become\nsubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\n      We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract\nDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual\nplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages\nfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,\nwe settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In\nconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to\ndefend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative\npublicity.

Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,\nhistorical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our\nreserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a\nsignificant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.\n      We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who\nuse our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver.

Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have\nbeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate\nconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.\nFurther, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.\nAdditional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business.

In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.\n      The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and\nchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size\nand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required\nfor a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\n      We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growth\nofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain\ninternal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to\nconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material\nweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market\nprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC\nor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and\nother effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nITEM 1B.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the\nperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The\nclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of\ncertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny\nthese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\n     Other Legal Proceedings\n     While it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the\nmatters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be\nmaterial to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal\nproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims\nrelated to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United\nStates where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government\ninvestigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and\ngovernment investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable\npreliminary and interim rulings.\nITEM 4.

Prior to that date, there was\nno public trading market for our common stock.\n     Holders of our Common Stock\n     As of February 22, 2022, there were 1,418 holders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record\nholders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.\n     Dividend Policy\n     We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, to fund the\ndevelopment and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The terms of certain of our\noutstanding debt instruments restrict our ability to pay dividends or make distributions on our common stock, and we may enter into credit agreements or other\nborrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends or make distributions on our capital stock.

The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly\nchanged market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations,\nfinancial position, and cash flows. Various governmental restrictions, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency, multiple cities\u2019 and states\u2019\ndeclarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures\nhave, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.\nFurthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to be\nimpacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.\n      COVID-19 Response Initiatives\n      We continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believe\nwe will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 through\npreserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic has\nreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by\nlaunching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.\n      To comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering in\nmost markets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, to\nwork remotely.\n      As vaccination rates increase in the United States, we are observing that consumer demand for Mobility is recovering faster than driver availability, and\nconsumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driver\nincentives to improve driver availability in the near-term.\n      While we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,\nresults of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any future\nwaves or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additional\nactions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the further impact on the business of Drivers, Merchants, consumers, and business partners, and other\nfactors identified in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n      Driver Classification Developments\n      The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged\ncompetitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n      On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled that\nProposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the\nProtect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.\n      To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\n      Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y.

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our app\nwas switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority\ndecision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\n      On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling. Subsequently, we initiated a historical claims settlement process for UK\ndrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bring\ntheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.\n      On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving\nwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement\nprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.\n      On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. The pension regulator has\nconfirmed that Uber will be required to pay historic company contributions, but that we are not required to pay the driver component of historic pension\ncontributions unless we fail to comply in which case the amount equivalent to those contributions would be payable as a penalty. We have completed the\nenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.\n      Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement of historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have\nextended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.\nWe are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings will\ntake place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.\n      In September 2021, a Netherlands court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\n      If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we\nwould incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including\nminimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential\npenalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model,\nand we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, result of\noperations, financial position, and cash flows.\n      For a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating\ncondition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled \u201c-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-\nemployees\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and Note 15 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Part\nII, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n      In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of\nrevenue, incentives and promotions as further described in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d and the section titled \u201cCritical Accounting\nEstimates\u201d in Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n                                                                                                        50", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4750, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a26791b-7eb1-4154-9867-6326874a6e49": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a26791b-7eb1-4154-9867-6326874a6e49", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05234ea8-c802-407d-a0c6-2f931e06e26a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "14acdf7083e619b9fe88689aa718c866b1d25fb005a24a41dbed2f7b950bbae0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Financial and Operational Highlights\n                                                                                                                   Year Ended December 31,                                      Constant Currency(1)\n                                                                                                                                                         2020 to 2021 %\n(In millions, except percentages)                                                                                    2020                2021                 Change           2020 to 2021 % Change\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (\u201cMAPCs\u201d)(2), (3)                                                                          93                 118                  27   %\nTrips(2)                                                                                                                 5,025                6,368                  27   %\nGross Bookings(2)                                                                                              $       57,897      $       90,415                    56   %                         53  %\nRevenue                                                                                                        $       11,139      $       17,455                    57   %                         54  %\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.(4)                                                            $       (6,768)     $          (496)                  93   %\nMobility Adjusted EBITDA                                                                                       $        1,169      $         1,596                   37   %\nDelivery Adjusted EBITDA                                                                                       $         (873)     $          (348)                  60   %\nAdjusted EBITDA(1), (2)                                                                                        $       (2,528)     $          (774)                  69   %\n\n\n     (1) See the section titled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure.\n     (2) See the section titled \u201cCertain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below for more information.\n     (3)MAPCs presented for annual periods are MAPCs for the fourth quarter of the year.\n     (4)Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. includes stock-based compensation expense of $827 million and $1.2 billion during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n\n\n     Highlights for 2021\n     Overall Gross Bookings increased by $32.5 billion in 2021, up 56%, or 53% on a constant currency basis, compared to 2020. Delivery Gross Bookings grew\n66% from 2020, on a constant currency basis, due to an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket sizes as a result of stay-at-home order demand related to\nCOVID-19, as well as continued expansion across U.S. and international markets. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase\nin certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for\nservices provided. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 36%, on a constant currency basis, from 2020, due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from the\nimpacts of COVID-19.\n     Revenue was $17.5 billion, or up 57% year-over-year, reflecting the overall growth in our Delivery business and an increase in Freight revenue attributable to\nthe acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in\nvolumes with our top shippers.\n     Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $496 million, a 93% improvement year-over-year, driven bya$1.6 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of our\nATG Business to Aurora, a$1.6 billion               pre-tax net benefit relating to Uber\u2019s equity investments,as well as reductions in our fixed cost structure and increased\nvariable cost efficiencies. Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also included $1.2 billion of stock-based compensation expense.\n     Adjusted EBITDA loss was $774 million, improving $1.8 billion from 2020 with Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit of $1.6 billion. Additionally, Delivery\nAdjusted EBITDA loss of $348 million, improved $525 million and Delivery Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of Delivery Gross Bookings improved to\n(0.7)% from (2.9)%, compared to 2020.\n     We ended the year with $4.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\n     Other Developments for 2021\n     Acquisitions\n     Remaining Interests in Cornershop\n     In August 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d), or 47%, on a fully-diluted\nbasis, in an all-stock transaction.\n     Drizly\n     On October 12, 2021, we completed the acquisition of 100% ownership interest in The Drizly Group, Inc.

The increase in\nGross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 71%, or 66% on a constant currency basis, due to an increase in food delivery\norders and higher basket sizes as a result of stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19, as well as continued expansion across U.S. and international\nmarkets. The increase was also driven by Mobility Gross Bookings growth of 38%, or 36% on a constant currency basis, due to increases in Trip volumes as the\nbusiness recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments\nand incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costs\nrelated to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuring\nand related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily for\nseverance and other termination benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.\n      These activities were designed to generate an aggregate cost savings of at least $1.0 billion annually when compared to our original fourth quarter 2020\nplanned cost structure, with the largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair our\nability to conduct any of our key business functions.

Mobility Take Rate was 19.0%, down from 22.9% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in Mobility Driver\nincentives, as Mobility Driver additions have been outpaced by higher demand recovery in the U.S. and other markets.\n     Mobility adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility revenue, partially offset by variable costs attributable to the\noverall growth of the business.\n     Delivery Segment\n     For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Delivery revenue increased $4.5 billion, or 114% and Delivery adjusted\nEBITDA loss improved $525 million, or 60%.\n     Delivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 66%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase in\nfood delivery orders and higher basket sizes as a result of stay-at-home demand related to COVID-19, combined with continued expansion across U.S. and\ninternational markets. Take Rate improved to 16.2% from 12.9% compared to the same period in 2020 driven by a decrease in incentive spend combined with an\noverall improvement in basket sizes. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier payments\nand incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.\n     Delivery adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery revenue, partially offset by a $2.6 billion increase in cost of\nrevenue as well as a $710 million increase in consumer promotions, brand marketing, and employee headcount costs.\n     Freight Segment\n     For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Freight revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 111% and Freight adjusted\nEBITDA loss improved $97 million, or 43%.\n     Freight revenue increased primarily            attributable to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue is\nalso driven by thegrowth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers.\n     Freight adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily attributable to a $135 million improvement in gross profit as a result of increased load margins, partially\noffset by an increase in employee headcount costs.\n\n\n                                                                                                      59", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5698, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8855ab67-7821-4b67-9013-1544289b0131": {"__data__": {"id_": "8855ab67-7821-4b67-9013-1544289b0131", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9cfebb7c-0fa7-4edd-a8c9-e97b9ca651de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bf9b6ccda9298541ffed9a9f05b314f457b6a9da527762ab50ba13f73c61c394", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "All Other\n     For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, All Other revenue decreased $127 million, or 94% and All Other\nadjusted EBITDA loss improved $450 million, or 98%.\n     All Other revenue and All Other adjusted EBITDA loss improved primarily due                           to the favorable impact of the sale of our ATG Business in the first quarter of\n2021 and the JUMP Divestiture in the second quarter of 2020.\nCertain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n     Adjusted    EBITDA and revenue growth rates in constant currency are non-GAAP financial measures.

MAPCs is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Delivery\norder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our\nplatform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC.

In addition to revenue, net income\n(loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA and revenue growth rates in constant currency, which are\ndescribed below, to evaluate our business. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures because they are key measures used by our management to\nevaluate our operating performance. Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in\nunderstanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors. Our calculation of these non-\nGAAP financial measures may differ from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures, if any, reported by our peer companies. These non-GAAP financial measures\nshould not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n     Adjusted EBITDA\n     We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding (i) income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, (ii) net income (loss)\nattributable to non-controlling interests, net of tax, (iii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iv) income (loss) from equity method investments, (v) interest\nexpense, (vi) other income (expense), net, (vii) depreciation and amortization, (viii) stock-based compensation expense, (ix) certain legal, tax, and regulatory\nreserve changes and settlements, (x) goodwill and asset\n\n\n                                                                                                      61", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5, "end_char_idx": 5706, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c4b91cc-d81f-41db-b214-0de27bf50ddd": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c4b91cc-d81f-41db-b214-0de27bf50ddd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "339bd7c2-229a-4beb-acaf-97d5c6312514", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dd80efc2a364f392e851464e6a871d62740774794a7cc0f31d4c1f45b73e000b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "71dd0592-4577-496b-a0c4-073aa84664a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1acef1c314aae0d37e07f5d33007d4549ff41050a3208771e50fd649b2c2d34f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "impairments/loss on sale of assets, (xi) acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses, (xii) restructuring and related charges and (xiii) other items not\nindicative of our ongoing operating performance, including COVID-19 response initiatives related payments for financial assistance to Drivers personally impacted\nby COVID-19, the cost of personal protective equipment distributed to Drivers, Driver reimbursement for their cost of purchasing personal protective equipment,\nthe costs related to free rides and food deliveries to healthcare workers, seniors, and others in need as well as charitable donations.\n      We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management team to evaluate our operating\nperformance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions, including those relating to operating expenses.

The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily driven\nby an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase in our insurance reserves, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and prepaid expenses\nand lower operating lease liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities also reflects a $1.0 billion cash inflow related to a legacy auto insurance transfer.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accounting\nestimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have\nbeen used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience and\non various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to the\ninherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.\n\n\n                                                                                                         64", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3924, "end_char_idx": 6127, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c821a2f-fc91-43bc-a71a-79058f25459e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c821a2f-fc91-43bc-a71a-79058f25459e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae29d069-77b1-4c86-b839-8b7bfded6f4c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "75793111eb967c41fdefff823031c66269301815a773082d6a2950835dcfa145", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d330cbf3-f4bb-4f59-9693-a68341f7428b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5773cf9bf9f8fe424e15cfb7e6da8c89848b19ea5cedd3c6dea142df9b9ef39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our\nconsolidated financial statements. For additional information, see the disclosure included in Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\n      Revenue Recognition\n      We derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products and\nDelivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants with\nend-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and we\nhave no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.\n      Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user\nand are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). We\nhave concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Delivery\ntransactions. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact the accounting for certain payments and\nincentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.\n      In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsetting\nagainst any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,\nuncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.\n      Driver Incentives\n      We offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided to\ncustomers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the service\nreceived. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.\n      End-User Discounts and Promotions\n      We offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate\nclassification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotions\nwhich are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\n      Business Combinations\n      We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated\nfair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such\nvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,\nand trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, useful\nlives, and discount rates.\n      Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a\nresult, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as\nacquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nDuring the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,\nwith the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n      Embedded Derivatives\n      During 2015, we had issued convertible notes that contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting. These embedded features are composed of\nconversion options that have the economic characteristics of a contingent early redemption feature settled in shares of our stock rather than cash, because the total\nnumber of shares of our common stock delivered to settle these embedded features will have a fixed value.

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost and\nare subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.\nInvestments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with\nthe changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account for\ninvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.\n      Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requires\njudgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimated\nfair value of our investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available including observed transactions such as equity financing\ntransactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similar\nto the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.\n      We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equity\nsecurities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If an\nequity investment is considered to be impaired we will establish a new carrying value for the investment and recognize an impairment loss through our\nconsolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below its\namortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the\ndifference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-down\nof the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors\nconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality\nof the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare\nthe present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-\nrelated impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance\nsheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome (loss), net of tax.

Changes in these estimates and assumptions could affect the calculation of the fair value of the investments and the determination of the impairment\ncharges.\n      Goodwill Impairment Assessment\n      We review goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be\nimpaired. We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying\nvalues for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers review\nfinancial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.\n      Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,\nbusiness, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affecting\nthe reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test\nis then performed.\n      Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant estimates and\nassumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,\nrisk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.\n      Loss Contingencies\n      We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, indirect tax examinations, or government inquiries and investigations that may arise in the\nordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when\nwe believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n      We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the\nestimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change\nbased on new information and future events.\n      The outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved\nagainst us for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, including in a particular reporting\nperiod in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.\n      Income Taxes\n      We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The\nestablishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to\ndetermine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenue\nand expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected\nfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and\nexternal comparable data and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracy or validity of such\nassumptions, estimates or actual results.\n      We account for uncertainty in tax positions by recognizing a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be\nsustained upon examination.

While we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax\noutcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit.

The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the\nultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not\nreported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and\nloss experience. In addition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which\nconsider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new\ninformation becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.\n      All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of the\ninsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual results\ndepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,\nand social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the near\nterm from the estimated amounts.\n      While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.\n      Stock-Based Compensation\n      We have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members of\nour board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstanding\nRSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards contains\nservice-based vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for the\nmajority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financial\nand operation metrics. The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.\n      We account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accounting\nstandards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account\nfor forfeitures when they occur.\n      We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-\nScholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interest\nrates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.\n      These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\n       \u2022    Expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\n       \u2022    Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n       \u2022    Expected volatility. We estimate the volatility of our common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of\n            our own common shares within the same length of period as the expected term.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n      We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\n      Interest Rate Risk\n      Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point\nincrease or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\n      The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 million\nas of December 31, 2021.\n      Investment Risk\n      Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We\ndid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market\nfunds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate\nrisk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in\ninterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\n      We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to\nvalue given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.\nThese investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in\nthe fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set\nperiod of time after a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.\n      Foreign Currency Risk\n      We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other\noperating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is\ndiversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\n      We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement\nof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency\nrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into\nderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\n\n\n                                                                                                          69", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 4595, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ebac96b-758b-4dbd-9491-2ae84a6bc32e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ebac96b-758b-4dbd-9491-2ae84a6bc32e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "71ff29a7-69f6-47be-8e84-7e28c4ba0cc0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68446252d6afb9e24fc78050d373ec4f1e38c69e0ea91df416ebabb23542ba27", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2021, based on criteria established in            Internal Control - Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\n31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances.

Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and\n(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the\ncritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nPresentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-Users\nAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of the\nCompany\u2019s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged to\nend-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal or\nagent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. This determination impacts the presentation of revenue on a gross or net basis as well as the\npresentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the year\nended December 31, 2021, the Company\u2019s Mobility and Delivery revenue, net of incentives, was $15.3 billion and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions,\nrefunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, including\nincentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing the\npresentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,\nwhich in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to whether\ntransaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process, including controls over the\npresentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, trip\ntransaction attributes and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driver\nstatements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue and\nincome statement classification.\nValuation of Insurance Reserves\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents\nthe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount\nfor losses incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods\napplied to historical claim and loss experience. In addition, management uses assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development\npatterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends, severity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed by\nmanagement and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. The Company\u2019s short-term and long-term insurance reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2021 totaled $4.0 billion.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are the\nsignificant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity\nand effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the actuarial methods and management\u2019s significant assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment patterns and expected loss costs.

       NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n      Description of Business\n      Uber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is\na technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects\nconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers\n(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and\nother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to\nas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\nexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.\n      Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\n      Basis of Presentation\n      The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States\n(\u201cGAAP\u201d). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)\nwhere we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information. All intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated.\n      Use of Estimates\n      The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the\nreported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which\nmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of\ninvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of\nacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;\ncertain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual\nresults could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supporting\ncertain of these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in particular, our impairment assessment related to the determination of the fair values of certain\ninvestments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the global\nfinancial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operations\nand financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.\n      Concentration of Credit Risk\n      Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject to\ncredit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government and\nagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or\ncommercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit\nquality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of funds\nwithheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on a\nlimited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users. Payment service\nproviders are financial institutions or credit card companies that we believe are of high credit quality.

COVID-19 has rapidly impacted market and economic\nconditions globally. In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, various governmental restrictions have been implemented, including business activities and travel\nrestrictions, and \u201cshelter-at-home\u201d orders, that have had an adverse impact on our business and operations by reducing, in particular, the global demand for\nMobility offerings, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it continues to\nproduce around the world, it is not possible to predict the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, results of\noperations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on\nfuture developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be further\nresurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financial\nmarkets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all of\nwhich are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n      Cash and Cash Equivalents\n      Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash held in checking and savings accounts as well as investments in money market funds, commercial paper, U.S.\ngovernment and agency securities, and corporate bonds. We consider all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three\nmonths or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

As of December 31, 2020, the funds served as collateral for us and our subsidiary\u2019s current and future claim settlement obligations under the\nindemnification agreements for these insurance policies as included in insurance reserves on theconsolidated balance sheet.

We elected the \u201cpackage of practical expedients,\u201d which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 our\nprior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from lease\ncomponents, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for\nall leases that qualify.\n      We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic\nbenefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an\nasset which we do not own. Right of use (\u201cROU\u201d) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our\nobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities\nare recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future\nlease payments is our incremental borrowing rate (\u201cIBR\u201d), because the interest rate implicit in most of our leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a\nhypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the\nlease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed\npayments or in-substance fixed payments are included in our lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area\nmaintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those\npayments are incurred.\n      Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated\nbalance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense is\nrecognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method. As of December\n31, 2020 and 2021, less than 12% of our operating lease ROU assets related to leased assets were outside of the U.S.\n      Acquisitions\n      We account for acquisitions of entities or asset groups that qualify as businesses in accordance with ASC 805, \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d (\u201cASC 805\u201d). The\npurchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the\nacquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year\nfrom the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion\nof the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are\nrecorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations for further information.\n      Goodwill\n      Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is allocated to reporting units\nexpected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter, or whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign\ngoodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of\nevents or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after\nassessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nthen additional impairment testing is not required.

If, after\nassessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,\nthen additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.\n      The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,\ngoodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment\nloss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Our marketable equity securities in\npublicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investments\nin non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, with remeasurements to fair value only upon the occurrence of observable price changes in orderly\ntransactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whether\nnon-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.\nNon-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities for\nimpairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,\nbut would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, a\nsignificant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,\nor a completed auction process for the same or similar securities for an amount less than the carrying amount of the investments in those securities. If an\nimpairment exists, a loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the\ninvestment. We include investments in equity securities within investments on the consolidated balance sheets.\n      Debt Securities\n      Accounting for our debt securities varies depending on the legal form of the security, our intended holding period for the security, and the nature of the\ntransaction. Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are initially recorded at fair value. Investments in marketable debt securities\ninclude commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equity\nsecurities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-\nfor-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fair\nvalue recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.\n      As of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyond\none year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Certain investments in non-marketable debt securities\nclassified as available-for-sale debt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.\n      Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt Securities\n      We account for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (\u201cASC 326\u201d). We\nadopted ASC 326 on January 1, 2020, on a modified retrospective basis. Under ASC 326, at each reporting period, we evaluate our available-for-sale debt\nsecurities at the individual security level to determine whether there is a decline in the fair value below its amortized cost basis (an impairment). In circumstances\nwhere we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell, the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, the difference between fair value and\namortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated statements of operations, with a corresponding write-down of the security\u2019s amortized cost. In\ncircumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether a\ncredit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, credit\nratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cash\nflows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the\ndifference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment\nto net income (loss).

Evidence of a loss in value might include, but\nwould not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain an earnings\ncapacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financial\nresults and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect the\nvalue of our investments.\n      Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for Impairment\n      We evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\nof an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carrying\namount of such asset groups to the future undiscounted cash flows it expects the asset group to generate. If we consider the asset group to be impaired, the\nimpairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.\n      Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments\n      Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to\nmeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the\nlowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:\n      Level 1      Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\n\n      Level 2       Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are\n                        not active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n\n\n      Level 3      Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\n      Our primary financial instruments include cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, investments, accounts payable, accrued\nliabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Refer to Note 3 \u2013\nInvestments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.\n      Variable Interest Entities\n      We evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,\ninvolve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that an\nentity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most\nsignificantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of\nwhether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interests\nin a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer to Note 16 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\n      Revenue Recognition\n      We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our obligations. We derive our revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of our platform, on-\ndemand lead generation, and related services, including facilitating payments from end-users. The service enables Drivers and Merchants to seek, receive and\nfulfill on-demand requests from end-users seeking Mobility or Delivery services (collectively the \u201cUber Service\u201d). Beginning in 2020, in certain markets we also\ngenerate revenue from end-users. We charge a direct fee for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Additionally, we derive revenue from\ncustomers' use of Freight services.\n      We periodically reassess our revenue recognition policies as new offerings become material, and business models and other factors evolve.\n\n\n                                                                                                          87", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5444, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3589b5b8-4778-4cd0-95ae-ec11818e2406": {"__data__": {"id_": "3589b5b8-4778-4cd0-95ae-ec11818e2406", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34fc48cd-ab00-4565-9bfa-e1efc4069d13", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0df292abcb6bfa6174b3a5dfc8edaffa8d98fc8f5d8aadf4a0de20d415122b38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce9f0cf3-9efa-451a-b356-807772d190fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2bb44e0b0e12380efe57baba13a8f99f08d8abf7c7dc5d247b3b9198aa87813b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Mobility and Delivery Agreements\n      We primarily enter into Master Services Agreements (\u201cMSA\u201d) with Drivers and Merchants to use the platform. The MSA defines the service fee we charge\nDrivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.\nThe acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between us\nand the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.\n      The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-\nusers to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.\n      In 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation to\nDrivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip is\ncomplete. We present revenue on a net basis for these transactions, as we do not control the service provided by Drivers to end-users. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.\n      Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for delivery\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contracts\nshall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,\nwhich represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-users\nof $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, we recognized revenue from end-users of $710 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $2.4 billion\nassociated with these delivery transactions.\n      In all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, this\nclass of end-users are not our customers.\n      Principal vs. Agent Considerations\n      Judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentation\nof revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for other\nparties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers and\nMerchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.\n      For the majority of Mobility and Delivery transactions, our role is to provide the Uber Service to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a successful trip or\nDelivery service to end-users. We concluded we do not control the good or service provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users as (i) we do not pre-purchase\nor otherwise obtain control of the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 goods or services prior to its transfer to the end-user; (ii) we do not direct Drivers and Merchants to\nperform the service on our behalf, and (iii) we do not integrate services provided by Drivers and Merchants with our other services and then provide them to end-\nusers.

We recognize revenue when a Delivery transaction is complete.\n      In the majority of transactions, the service fee paid by Merchants is a fixed percentage of the meal price. The service fee paid by Couriers is the difference\nbetween the delivery fee amount paid by the end-user and the amount earned by the Couriers. End-users are quoted a fixed price for the meal delivery while we\npay Couriers based on time and distance for the delivery. Therefore, we earn a variable amount on a transaction and may realize a loss on the transaction. We\ntypically receive the service fee within a short period of time following the completion of a delivery.\n      Freight\n      We derive our Freight revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers. With the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) during the\nfourth quarter of 2021, our Freight revenue also includes revenue from transportation management. Refer to Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations for further\ninformation on the Transplace acquisition.\n      Brokerage\n      Brokerage revenue represents the gross amount of fees charged to Shippers for our services because we control the service provided to customers. Costs\nincurred with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transport\nfreight. We enter into contracts with Shippers that define the price for each shipment and payment terms. Our acceptance of the shipment request establishes\nenforceable rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin to\ndestination. We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless of\npayment by the Shipper. We invoice the Shipper upon satisfaction of our sole performance obligation to transport a Shipper\u2019s freight using our network of\nindependent freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over the\nperiod of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are\nnot material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.\n      Transportation Management\n      We provide an integrated logistics and transportation service, which can include shipment planning, freight optimization, carrier assignment, load\nmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation services. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration of\nthese services to transport the Shipper\u2019s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis. The majority of our transportation management revenue is recognized on a gross\nbasis in the amount of gross fees charged to Shippers upon satisfaction of our performance obligation because we control the service provided to customers. Costs\nincurred with carriers for these transactions are recorded in cost of revenue. In transactions where we do not control the service provided to customers, we\nrecognize revenue on a net basis. Revenue is recognized as our performance obligation is satisfied, which generally represents the transit period from origin to\ndestination by a third-party carrier. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end are not\nmaterial. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 60 days upon completion of our performance obligation.\n      Principal vs. Agent Considerations\n      Judgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Shippers.

New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a variety\nof modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We were\nresponsible for providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of each\ntrip. After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.\nRefer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture.\n      Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration Revenue\n      In 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology. Under this\ncollaboration agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition and\npresentation of the consideration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests for further information.\n      Incentives to Customers\n      Incentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fair\nvalue of the good or service received. Incentives to customers that are not provided in exchange for a distinct good or service are evaluated as variable\nconsideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Since\nincentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.\n      Incentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. We\nexpense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient under\nASC 340-40-25-4 and expense costs to acquire new customer contracts as incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. The amount\nrecorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is established\nusing amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,\n2019, 2020 and 2021 were immaterial.\n      In some transactions, incentives and payments made to customers may exceed the revenue earned in the transaction. In these transactions, the resulting\nshortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\n      Advertising Revenue\n      We derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.\nAdvertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks. Revenue is presented on a gross basis in the\namount billed to merchants as we control the advertisement before it is transferred to the end-user.\n      End-User Discounts and Promotions\n      We offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not our customers) to encourage use of our platform. These are offered in various forms of discounts\nand promotions and include:\n      Targeted end-user discounts and promotions:                 These discounts and promotions are offered to a limited number of end-users in a market to acquire, re-engage,\nor generally increase end-users use of the Platform, and are akin to a coupon. An example is an offer providing a discount on a limited number of rides or meal\ndeliveries during a limited time period. We record the cost of these discounts and promotions to end-users who are not our customers as sales and marketing\nexpenses at the time they are redeemed by the end-user.\n      End-user referrals:       These referrals are earned when an existing end-user (the referring end-user) refers a new end-user (the referred end-user) to the platform\nand the new end-user who is not our customer takes their first ride on the platform.

We have no significant financing components in our contracts with customers.\n      Stock-Based Compensation\n      We account for stock-based compensation expense in accordance with the fair value recognition and measurement provisions of GAAP, which requires\ncompensation cost for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures when they\noccur. The fair value of stock-based awards, granted or modified, is determined on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value,\nusing appropriate valuation techniques.\n      Service-Based Awards\n      We record stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options and restricted stock units (\u201cRSU(s)\u201d) on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period, which is generally four years.\n      For stock options with service-based vesting conditions only and stock purchase rights provided under our employee stock purchase plan, the valuation model,\ntypically the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, incorporates various assumptions including expected stock price volatility, expected term and risk-free interest\nrates. We estimate the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of our own shares or\ncomparable publicly traded companies in our industry group. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with\na term equal to the expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be \u201cplain vanilla\u201d\noptions, as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. We estimate the expected\nterm for non-employees\u2019 options based on the contractual term. U.S. The expected dividend yield is 0.0% as we have not paid and do not anticipate paying\ndividends on our common stock.\n      Performance-Based Awards\n      We have granted restricted common stock awards (\u201cRSA(s)\u201d), RSUs, stock appreciation rights (\u201cSAR(s)\u201d), stock options, and warrants that vest upon the\nsatisfaction of both service-based and performance-based conditions. The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years. The\nperformance-based conditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as our financial or operating metrics, and/or the\noccurrence of a qualifying event, defined as the earlier of (i) the closing of certain specific liquidation or change in control transactions, or (ii) an initial public\noffering (\u201cIPO\u201d). We record stock-based compensation expense for performance-based equity awards such as RSAs, RSUs, SARs, and stock options on an\naccelerated attribution method over the requisite service period, which is generally four years, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to\nbe satisfied.\n      Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we had not recognized stock-based compensation expense for awards with performance-based conditions which include a\nqualifying event because the qualifying event described above had not yet occurred and was not considered probable. Upon the IPO, we recorded a cumulative\none-time stock-based compensation expense of $3.6 billion, determined using the grant-date fair values. Stock-based compensation related to remaining service-\nbased awards after the IPO is recorded over the remaining requisite service period.

The service-based condition for these awards generally is satisfied over four years. The performance-based\nconditions generally are satisfied upon achieving specified performance targets, such as the occurrence of a qualifying event, as described above for performance-\nbased awards. The market-based conditions are satisfied upon our achievement of specified fully-diluted equity values, as determined based on our stock price.\n      For market-based awards, we determine the grant-date fair value utilizing a Monte Carlo valuation model, which incorporates various assumptions including\nexpected stock price volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rates, expected date of a qualifying event, and expected capital raise percentage. We estimate the\nvolatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies in its\nindustry group. We estimate the expected term based on various exercise scenarios. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at\nthe time of grant. Prior to our IPO in May 2019, we estimated the expected date of a qualifying event based on third-party valuations of our common stock and\nestimated the expected capital raise percentage based on management's expectations at the time of measurement of the award's value.\n      We record stock-based compensation expense for market-based equity awards such as RSUs and stock options on an accelerated attribution method over the\nrequisite service period, and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. We determine the requisite service period by comparing\nthe derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite\nservice period.\n      Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d)\n      We recognize stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to our 2019 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The ESPP provides for\ntwelve-month offering periods, and each offering period includes two purchase periods of approximately six months. The ESPP allows eligible employees to\npurchase shares of our common stock at a 15 percent discount on the lower price of either (i) the offering period begin date or (ii) the purchase date. We estimate\nthe fair value of shares to be issued under the ESPP based on a combination of options valued                                       using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In 2019, we\ndetermine volatility over an expected term of six months based on our historical volatility and twelve months based on the average of our historical volatility and\nour peer group. In 2020 and 2021, we determine volatility over an expected term of six months and twelve months based on our historical volatility. We estimate\nthe expected term based on the contractual term.\n      Common Stock Fair Value\n      Subsequent to our IPO in May 2019, the fair value of common stock was determined on the grant date using the closing price of our common stock.\n      Prior to our IPO, the absence of an active market for our common stock required the Board of Directors, the members of which we believe have extensive\nbusiness, finance and venture capital experience, to determine the fair value of our common stock for purposes of granting stock-based awards and for calculating\nstock-based compensation expense. We obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist the Board of Directors in determining fair value.

Monetary assets\nand liabilities, and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured to the functional currency at the exchange rate in\neffect at the end of the period and are recorded in the current period consolidated statement of operations. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are\nrecorded in foreign exchange gains (losses), net within other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Subsidiary assets and liabilities\nwith non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at the month-end rate, retained earnings and other equity items are translated at historical rates, and\nrevenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.

Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restricted\ncommon stock, common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options, and the holders of the redeemable convertible preferred stock on a pro-rata basis\nassuming conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock.

The insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of the ultimate unpaid\nobligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but not reported as of the\nbalance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim and loss experience. In\naddition, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgment related to claim and loss development patterns and expected loss costs, which consider frequency trends,\nseverity trends, and relevant industry data. These reserves are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known.\nAdjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.

The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses\ncomparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation techniqueprimarily\nconsists of short-term revenue projections.\n      Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the\ninvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\n      An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could\nresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions.

Upon the completion of the merger, our investment in Series G preferred shares of Grab, which was previously accounted for as an investment in\nan available-for-sale debt security due to the redemption feature of the shares, converted into the newly issued Class A ordinary shares of the publicly traded\ncompany. We recorded the fair value of our investment with changes in the fair value recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax through the date of\nthe conversion. Upon the conversion, we released the accumulative pre-tax unrealized gains on the investment of $2.8 billion recorded through other\ncomprehensive income and recognized them as unrealized gains in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations for year ended\nDecember 31, 2021. Subsequent to the conversion, we recognized unrealized losses of $1.2 billion on the investment in other income (expense), net in our\nconsolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the fair value change of the equity security.\n      As of December 31, 2021, our Grab investment has been classified as a marketable equity security with a readily determinable fair value (Level 1) in the table\npresenting our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n      The following table summarizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement for our Grab investment as of\nDecember 31, 2020:\n\n\nFair value method                                                                                Relative weighting                                      Key unobservable input\nFinancing transactions                                                                                  100%                 Transaction price per share                                        $6.16\n                                                                                                                             Volatility                                                          53%\n                                                                                                                             Estimated time to liquidity                                     1.75 years\n      During the first quarter of 2020, we determined the fair value of our available-for-sale debt securities in Grab had declined below their amortized cost based\non an analysis of the observed valuation declines of Grab\u2019s publicly-traded competitive peer group and representative stock market indices. These observed inputs\nwere considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that was\napplied to the valuation derived from Grab\u2019s latest financing transaction which occurred earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and prior to the announcement of\nCOVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for Mobility services. As a result, the carrying value of the investment in Grab was reduced by\n$230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,\nrepresenting the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balance\nsheet and a corresponding credit-related impairment charge recorded to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. Due to the\nsignificant uncertainty about Grab\u2019s ability to repay the redemption amount of the securities on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected was\nconsidered to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost was\nconsidered to reflect a credit-related impairment charge.\n      The fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by the\ninvestee during that quarter. As a result, we recognized a reversal of the previously recorded allowance for\n\n\n                                                                                                       100", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 7101, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0e0027e-f0d6-4533-978b-fd744bb71176": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0e0027e-f0d6-4533-978b-fd744bb71176", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c7f1a41f-31ab-47cb-8ea0-ac0d862fbeef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cca67e7498a94d9e996097d2e98f40e9c9d096232611bd7bda36352c1ab5e509", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78c8b08b-9c8d-4c32-b758-f372ca3dfb13", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3e4c7b4b129eef94f3b063e8807f1becba0c5448b2f15060614e38ff420e8c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "credit loss in the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding reversal of the credit-related impairment charge to other income (expense), net in the consolidated\nstatement of operations.\n     Lime Investments\n     Our ownership in Lime is comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note\n(collectively, the \u201c2020 Lime Investments\u201d). The 2020 Lime Investments were received as part of the transaction by which we divested of our JUMP business.\nRefer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information regarding the JUMP Divestiture and the 2020 Lime Investments. Our investment in Lime Common Stock\nand representation on Lime\u2019s board of directors gives us the ability to exercise significant influence over Lime.

The 2020 Lime Investments are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value reflected in earnings. The fair value of\nthe 2020 Lime Investments as of December 31, 2020 of $134 million was determined by referencing a transaction in a convertible note that is junior to the Lime\nConvertible Note and used as an input to an OPM.

This evaluation consists of several factors including, but not limited to, an assessment of a significant adverse change in the economic\nenvironment, significant adverse changes in the general market condition of the geographies and industries in which our investees operate, and other publicly\navailable information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising from\nCOVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, was\nless than their carrying value.\n      To determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,\nweighted at 80% and 20%, respectively. The CSE method assumes an if-converted scenario, where the OPM approach allocates equity value to individual\nsecurities within the investees\u2019 capital structure based on contractual rights and preferences. We computed a range of market adjustments based on observed\nmarket valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securities\noccurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs are\nconsidered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from the\nlatest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.\nA lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes of\nallocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event would\nresult in higher valuation (due to access to public markets and reduction in cost of capital), reduces valuation uncertainty, and generally assumes market and\nmacro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, we\nrecorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

In exchange for consideration contributed, we\nreceived a seat on MLU B.V.\u2019s board and an initial 38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V. Certain contingent equity issuances\nof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity ownership interest to approximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our ability\nto exercise significant influence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows of\nMLU B.V. The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\n     2020\n     During 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (\u201cDrive\u201d) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest. The contribution of\nDrive into MLU B.V. resulted in the dilution of our ownership in MLU B.V. from 38% to 35%. The gain recognized on the dilution of our interest was not material\nto our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. As part of this transaction, MLU B.V. contributed the assets and liabilities of its\nautonomous driving unit into a new legal entity, Yandex Self Driving Group B.V. (\u201cSDG\u201d), in which Yandex contributed additional capital. The reduction of our\nownership interest to 20% in SDG, initially valued at $42 million, did not result in a material dilution gain.\n     2021\n     On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the \u201cFramework Agreement\u201d) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and SDG and we\nwould sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the \u201cInitial Closing\u201d). Subsequent to the Initial Closing,\nYandex spun-off, by way of demerger from MLU B.V., its delivery businesses: Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery (collectively, \u201cDemerged\nBusinesses\u201d). Immediately following the demerger, Yandex acquired all of our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses (\u201cDemerger Share Closing\u201d). In\nconnection with the Framework Agreement, we granted Yandex an option (\u201cMLU B.V. Call Option\u201d) to acquire our remaining equity interest in MLU B.V. during\nthe two-year period following the Initial Closing. The total consideration paid by Yandex to us for the transaction was $1.0 billion in cash allocated as follows: (i)\n$276 million for our 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V.; (ii) $412 million for our equity interest in the Demerged Businesses; (iii) $230 million for the MLU\nB.V. Call Option; and (iv) the remaining immaterial amounts to our interest in SDG.\n     Initial Closing\n     During the third quarter of 2021 and pursuant to the Framework Agreement, we completed the sale of our entire equity interest in SDG and 4.5% of equity\ninterest in MLU B.V. to Yandex. At the initial closing, we derecognized 4.5% of equity interest in MLU B.V. and recognized a gain of $106 million in other\nincome (expense), net on our consolidated statement of operations.

Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulated\nmultiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlying\nbusiness value, option term of 1.7 years, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).\n      MLU B.V. Basis Difference\n      Included in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate\nshare of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V.\nand amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translation\nadjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.\n      The table below provides the composition of the basis difference as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2387, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "463ff734-43d7-4c0a-a415-830c2ab76110": {"__data__": {"id_": "463ff734-43d7-4c0a-a415-830c2ab76110", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2b39fcd4-540c-44fa-9d9e-d5f7ddc15b54", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8264edb0327d43bb819ec89a0a62f6a9bb6970991adcbdf457007ee317b99cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "46ea4289-779e-473e-ab77-1705aaf306f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dbfe77036f4b0d34cbff2bf32c586b66dab4e292ce1cc5d79501e24b297a2746", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "As of December 31, 2021\nEquity method goodwill                                                                                                                                                 $                               545\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization                                                                                                                                                      54\nDeferred tax liabilities                                                                                                                                                                               (12)\nCumulative currency translation adjustments                                                                                                                                                          (107)\n        Basis difference                                                                                                                                               $                               480\n      We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-\nline method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years and 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Equity\nmethod goodwill is not amortized. The investment balance is reviewed for impairment whenever factors indicate that the carrying value of the equity method\ninvestment may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we determined that there was no impairment of our investment in MLU B.V. The future\neffect of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions as well as other factors will continue to be monitored.\n      Mission Bay 3 & 4\n      The Mission Bay 3 & 4 JV refers to Event Center Office Partners, LLC (\u201cECOP\u201d), a joint venture entity established in 2018, by Uber and two companies\n(\u201cLLC Partners\u201d) to manage the construction and operation of two office buildings owned by two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries. We contributed $136 million\ncash in exchange for a 45% interest in ECOP. The two LLC Partners own 45% and 10%, respectively. The equity ownership interest in ECOP remained at 45% as\nof December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n      In March 2020, the two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries took out new loans. Upon closing of the new financing, the proceeds were used to first pay off the\nexisting construction loan, then to cover the required operation reserve as well as various financing costs, and last, the remaining proceeds were distributed back to\nUber and the LLC Partners based on their ownership percentage. As a result, Uber received $91 million from the ECOP as a return of capital investment, and\nreduced the investment carrying value by the same amount.\n      We have significant influence over ECOP and we account for our investment in ECOP under the equity method. At each reporting period and a quarter in\narrears, we adjust the carrying value of our investment to reflect our proportionate share of ECOP\u2019s income or loss, and any impairments, with a corresponding\ncredit or debit, respectively, to income or loss from equity method investment, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations. During 2019, the\nconstruction was completed and leasing activities commenced. and immaterial amounts of equity earnings were recognized during 2019, 2020 and 2021. During\n2020 and 2021, we incurred an immaterial amount of lease payments with ECOP, which is a related party. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we determined that\nthere was no impairment of our investment in ECOP.\n\n\n                                                                                                      104", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2562, "end_char_idx": 6354, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b889497-9d40-417b-9078-61b5d82ee265": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b889497-9d40-417b-9078-61b5d82ee265", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "45668d80-bc72-4c0f-863e-aa0b28a47446", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42fcafca3341cd5d97fe19f6cf44b878cb7eb29ef620f90b48f6485a790fc64b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Note 5 \u2013 Property and Equipment, Net\n     The components of property and equipment, net as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                       As of December 31,\n                                                                                                                                                                 2020                      2021\nLand                                                                                                                                                   $                    66     $                   65\nBuilding and site improvements                                                                                                                                             711                       737\nLeasehold improvements                                                                                                                                                     435                       594\nComputer equipment                                                                                                                                                         560                       468\nLeased computer equipment                                                                                                                                                  596                       650\nLeased vehicles                                                                                                                                                               6                         7\nInternal-use software                                                                                                                                                      203                       258\nFurniture and fixtures                                                                                                                                                      83                         99\nDockless e-bikes                                                                                                                                                            \u2014                          \u2014\nConstruction in progress                                                                                                                                                   170                       157\n        Total                                                                                                                                                           2,830                      3,035\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization                                                                                                                        (1,016)                   (1,182)\n        Property and equipment, net                                                                                                                    $                1,814      $               1,853\n\n\n     We capitalized $76 million and $55 million in internal-use software costs during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, which is included\nin property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets.

In connection with the JV arrangement, we acquired a 49% interest in the JV, the principal asset of which was the Land.\n      In 2016, we and the JV Partner agreed to dissolve the JV and terminate our commitment to the lease of the Headquarters (together \u201cthe real estate transaction\u201d)\nand we retained a 49% indirect interest in the Land (\u201cIndirect Interest\u201d). Under the terms of the real estate transaction, we obtained the rights and title to the\npartially constructed building, completed the development of the two office buildings and retained a 100% ownership in the buildings. In connection with the real\nestate transaction, we also executed two 75-year land lease agreements (\u201cLand Leases\u201d). As of December 31, 2021, commitments under the Land Leases total $141\nmillion until February 2032. After 2032, the annual rent amount will adjust annually based on the prevailing consumer price index.\n      The real estate transaction is accounted for as a financing transaction of our 49% Indirect Interest due to our continuing involvement through a purchase option\non the Indirect Interest. As a financing transaction, the cash and deferred sales proceeds received from the real estate transaction are recorded as a financing\nobligation. As of December 31, 2021, our Indirect Interest of $65 million is included in property and equipment, net and a corresponding financing obligation of\n$76 million is included in other long-\n\n\n                                                                                                       107", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 171, "end_char_idx": 7539, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bf0d99a-3b1f-4dc2-9899-9dc3e5a0c2d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bf0d99a-3b1f-4dc2-9899-9dc3e5a0c2d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ec7f49f-0947-4433-b5ba-4cbec087f29f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "429fd8051459d48f2dc1bdaf778efa144d6887cfbb8315839ec44075a69dd2c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "term liabilities.

As a result, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test by comparing\nthe fair value of the New Mobility reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair value was determined by referencing market valuation multiples implied by companies\nthat have comparable businesses which is a Level 3 measurement. The carrying value of our New Mobility reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and as a result, a\ngoodwill impairment charge of $100 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations after consideration of\nimpairments of long-lived and other assets of the reporting unit.

The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability\ncomponent (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity\ncomponent of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not\nremeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as\nof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.\n      Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to\nadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the\nopening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible\nNotes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.\n      The fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\n      Senior Notes\n      In October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Senior Notes\u201d) and eight-\nyear notes with aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion due on November 1, 2026 (the \u201c2026 Senior Notes\u201d) in a private placement offering totaling $2.0\nbillion.

impairment charge related to our investment in Didi.\n            The 2021 rate impact for \u201cDeferred tax on investments\u201d was primarily driven by the deferred China and U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Didi\n            and the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, and Zomato.\n         (2)The 2019 rate impact for \u201cEntity restructuring\u201d is related to a series of transactions resulting in changes to our international legal structure, including a\n            redomiciliation of a subsidiary to the Netherlands and a transfer of certain intellectual property rights among wholly owned subsidiaries, primarily to align\n            its evolving operations. The redomiciliation resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign\n            deferred tax assets in an amount of $6.4 billion, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $1.4 billion (refer to the 2019 rate impact for \u201cChange in\n            unrecognized tax benefits\u201d). Based on available objective evidence, management believed it was not more-likely-than-not that these additional foreign\n            deferred tax assets will be realizable as of December 31, 2019 and, therefore, were offset by a full valuation allowance (refer to the 2019 rate impact for\n            \u201cValuation allowance\u201d) to the extent not offset by reserves for uncertain tax positions. The corresponding deferred tax asset and valuation allowance\n            balance were included in the \u201cFixed assets and intangible assets\u201d and \u201cValuation allowance\u201d lines, respectively, in the table below.\n            In the second quarter of 2020, we transferred certain intangible assets among our wholly-owned subsidiaries to align our structure to our evolving\n            operations. The transaction resulted in the establishment of deferred tax assets of $354 million; however, there was no financial statement benefit\n            recognized since the deferred tax asset was offset by a full valuation allowance.\n            To align our structure to our evolving operations, in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, we completed intercompany transfers of certain intangible\n            assets. These intercompany transfers did not have a material impact to the financial statements.\n\n\n

U.S. income tax expense, which will be incurred upon the eventual disposition\n         of the shares underlying our investments in Didi, Aurora, Grab, and Zomato. The current year tax expense and any subsequent changes in the recognition or\n         measurement of this deferred tax liability will be recorded in continuing operations.\n      Based on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions\u2019 deferred\ntax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred\ntax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary\ndifferences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factors, including future market\nconditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax\nassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferred\ntax assets of $13.4 billion and $13.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2021, the increase in the valuation allowance was primarily\nattributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,\nand tax credits generated during the year, offset partially by the release of the valuation allowance due to deferred tax liabilities recorded as a result of the\nacquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.\n      The indefinite carryforward period for net operating losses (\"NOLs\") means that indefinite-lived deferred tax liabilities can be considered as support for\nrealization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,\nwe realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferred\ntax liabilities being used as a source of income.\n      As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $3.2 billion that begin to expire in 2031 and $11.7 billion that have an unlimited\ncarryover period. As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. state NOL carryforwards of $10.2 billion that begin to expire in 2022 and $2.2 billion that have an\nunlimited carryover period. As of December 31, 2021, we had foreign NOL carryforwards of $507 million that begin to expire in 2023 and $10.1 billion that have\nan unlimited carryover period.\n      As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of $785 million that begin to expire in 2028. We had U.S. state research tax\ncredit carryforwards of $13 million that begin to expire in 2032 and $521 million that have an unlimited carryover period.\n\n\n                                                                                                        122", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4250, "end_char_idx": 7702, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8432f6ed-cf5b-48a7-917e-5c25147f0969": {"__data__": {"id_": "8432f6ed-cf5b-48a7-917e-5c25147f0969", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "94f23d29-47c3-4c63-b83f-bba4ccfd8465", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "563c2aaa155c8353f193cc75b180fe0c20b4b71e05f957b01f995cacbacf6957", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operating\nlosses, tax credits and other tax attributes may be limited.

The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 was $12 million and $18 million, respectively.\n      Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits\ncould significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are\nunable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.

The following table provides information about our\nsegments and a reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to loss from operations (in millions):\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                   Year Ended December 31,\n                                                                                                                                                           2019                2020            2021\nSegment adjusted EBITDA:\n  Mobility                                                                                                                                           $        2,071      $         1,169    $      1,596\n  Delivery                                                                                                                                                   (1,372)               (873)            (348)\n  Freight                                                                                                                                                      (217)               (227)            (130)\n  All Other(1)                                                                                                                                                 (750)               (461)             (11)\nTotal segment adjusted EBITDA                                                                                                                                  (268)               (392)           1,107\nReconciling items:Corporate G&A and Platform R&D(2), (3)                                                                                                     (2,457)             (2,136)         (1,881)\n  Depreciation and amortization                                                                                                                                (472)               (575)            (902)\n  Stock-based compensation expense                                                                                                                           (4,596)               (827)         (1,168)\n  Legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements                                                                                                   (353)                  35            (526)\n  Driver appreciation award                                                                                                                                    (299)                  \u2014                \u2014\n  Payroll tax on IPO stock-based compensation                                                                                                                    (86)                 \u2014                \u2014\n  Goodwill and asset impairments/loss on sale of assets                                                                                                           (8)              (317)            (157)\n  Acquisition, financing and divestitures related expenses                                                                                                        \u2014                  (86)           (102)\n  Accelerated lease costs related to cease-use of ROU assets                                                                                                      \u2014                (102)               (5)\n  COVID-19 response initiatives                                                                                                                                   \u2014                (106)             (54)\n  Gain on lease arrangement, net                                                                                                                                  \u2014                     5              \u2014\n  Restructuring and related charges, net                                                                                                                         (57)              (362)               \u2014\n  Legacy auto insurance transfer(4)                                                                                                                               \u2014                   \u2014             (103)\n  Mass arbitration fees                                                                                                                                           \u2014                   \u2014              (43)\nLoss from operations                                                                                                                                 $       (8,596)     $       (4,863)    $    (3,834)\n     (1)Includes historical results of ATG and Other Technology Programs and New Mobility.\n\n\n     (2) Excluding stock-based compensation expense.\n\n\n     (3) Includes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments.

litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,\nwe had recorded aggregate liabilities of $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters,\nrespectively, in accrued and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were\nprobable and reasonably estimable.\n      We are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged\nindependent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims,\nunfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act\n(\u201cTCPA\u201d) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and\nother matters. We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and\naudit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of\nCalifornia State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\nmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters\nwere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially\nadversely affected.\n      Driver Classification\n      California Attorney General Lawsuit\n      In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\n\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers\nperforming services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring\nentity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or\ntype of business performed for the hiring entity.\n      On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in\nSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages\nrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\n      On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed a\npetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November\n2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\n      Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers.

The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellate\nproceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction with\nthe trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit\nremains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the\nAlameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional.

The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion in\nwhich we argue that the motion is premature.

Our chances of success on\nthe merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.\n      Swiss Social Security Reclassification\n      Several Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of\nUber B.V. for social security or regulatory purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, a\nruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser Operations\nB.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as\ndependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and has\nno impact on our current operations.

Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March\n26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million against\nAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted its\nrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron and\nGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Google\non behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.\nWhether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.\nIn March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy.

During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the \u201cInitial Cornershop\nInvestment\u201d). The remaining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.\n      During the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreement\nin order for Uber to acquire Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior to the transaction close, Cornershop was restructured\nsuch that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as \u201cCS-Mexico\u201d), while all\nof the remaining Cornershop operations were to be held in the newly created CS-Global entity.\n      On July 6, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico.\nThis transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial Cornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-\nGlobal and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a combination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial Cornershop\nInvestment was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber\u2019s pre-acquisition ownership\npercentage, the new value was not materially different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at the\noriginal $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% of\nthe outstanding membership interests. As a result, we obtained the controlling financial interest in CS-Global and accounted for the acquisition as a business\ncombination. Concurrent with the CS-Global acquisition transaction, Uber, Cornershop and CS-Global entered into a put/call arrangement over the non-controlling\ninterest in CS-Global, providing CS-Global with the right through the call option (and obligation through the put option held by Cornershop) to purchase all of the\ninterests in CS-Mexico, contingent upon the receipt of regulatory approval in Mexico (\u201cCS-Mexico Put/Call\u201d).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 5857, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa579629-ab06-4c5d-8786-6c5dd0c93a8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa579629-ab06-4c5d-8786-6c5dd0c93a8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "59158fff-3112-4aab-9a22-c93a274102bd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36a918ede531f96e49d75276f08e625b5c6ce60746b6f97fbaa2e7ca09c276e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "99de3856-0342-4b6e-8e71-c1f2ec93e522", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "922e0c4d613657d87041971c7e0edb47f2a9131d327951e06c9565bc598c04c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at the\noriginal $50 million.

For the period from July 6, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2020, CS-Global contributed an immaterial amount of revenue and loss before taxes.\n      In December 2020, we received approval from Mexico\u2019s antitrust regulator to complete the CS-Mexico transaction. On January 11, 2021, CS-Global exercised\nthe call option through the CS-Mexico Put/Call agreement and acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in CS-Mexico, and we owned 55% of CS-Mexico\nthrough our ownership in CS-Global. The acquisition of CS-Mexico was accounted for as a business combination. The acquisition date fair value of the\nconsideration transferred for CS-Mexico was immaterial, and consisted of a combination of cash payment and equity payment in Uber common stock and the fair\nvalue of the CS-Mexico Put/Call remeasured at the acquisition date. As a result of remeasuring our prior CS-Mexico Put/Call held immediately prior to the\nbusiness combination, we recognized an immaterial loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. The loss was included in other income (expense), net in the\nconsolidated statement of operations.\n      In August 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop (or 47%, on a fully-diluted basis) in an all-stock\ntransaction. As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 million\nrestricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees. In addition, we issued 4 million stock options to replace assumed outstanding stock options. These\nreplacement stock options attributable to post-acquisition service are included in our option activity and are recognized as stock-based compensation expense.\n      The acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly, we did not recognize a\ngain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with this acquisition, the previously recognized\nnon-controlling interest was derecognized. Following this transaction, Cornershop became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\n      The total purchase price was determined to be $967 million, based on the number of shares issued and Uber\u2019s share price on the closing date. The fair value of\nthe 4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees was determined to be $202 million.

Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Drizly and anticipated operational synergies. Goodwill was assigned to\nour Delivery segment. The fair values assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management\u2019s estimates\nand assumptions at the time of acquisition. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are completed and\nadditional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including related deferred income taxes, become available. Tangible net\nassets were valued at their respective carrying amounts as of the acquisition date, as these amounts approximate their fair values.\n\n\n                                                                                                        141", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6, "end_char_idx": 5731, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1902534a-9a4f-4605-a0c2-9f48a62df567": {"__data__": {"id_": "1902534a-9a4f-4605-a0c2-9f48a62df567", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "60f5e806-6fdb-473d-96b3-dc291b97a593", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "169c97b438e8d68476aad64b8bf094946f2766bf59878add09746b6ff526bdf9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in\nmillions, except years):\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                            Weighted Average Remaining\n                                                                                                                                                      Fair Value                   Useful Life - Years\nConsumer relationship                                                                                                                       $                           60                                     5\nRetailer relationship                                                                                                                                                   90                                    10\nAdvertiser relationship                                                                                                                                               140                                     12\nDeveloped technology                                                                                                                                                    75                                     3\nTrade names                                                                                                                                                             30                                     6\n        Total                                                                                                                               $                         395\n      Consumer, retailer, and advertiser relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with Drizly end-users, retailers (such as liquor stores),\nand advertisers.

The acquisition date fair\nvalue of the consideration transferred for Transplace was $2.3 billion.\n      The following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition(in millions):\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                         Fair Value\nCash and cash equivalents                                                                                                                                                     $                              29\nAccounts receivable, net                                                                                                                                                                                   899\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets                                                                                                                                                                    23\nProperty and equipment, net                                                                                                                                                                                  44\nOperating lease right-of-use assets                                                                                                                                                                          57\nIntangible assets, net                                                                                                                                                                                     902\nGoodwill                                                                                                                                                                                                 1,438\nOther assets                                                                                                                                                                                                  3\n      Total assets acquired                                                                                                                                                                              3,395\nAccounts payable                                                                                                                                                                                          (516)\nOperating lease liabilities, current                                                                                                                                                                         (7)\nAccrued and other current liabilities                                                                                                                                                                     (363)\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current                                                                                                                                                                   (66)\nDeferred tax liability                                                                                                                                                                                    (163)\nOther long-term liabilities                                                                                                                                                                                  (1)\n      Total liabilities assumed                                                                                                                                                                        (1,116)\n      Net assets acquired                                                                                                                                                     $                          2,279\n      The excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.

The estimated fair value of the consideration received\nincluded the investment valued at $171 million and the $35 million of reimbursement of goods and services tax receivable from Zomato. As of December 31, 2021,\nwe had collected substantially all of the receivable. The fair value of the CCPS Preferred Shares was based primarily on the observed transaction price for a similar\nsecurity issued to new investors in close proximity to the time of our transaction with Zomato. The transaction resulted in a gain on disposal of $154 million\nrecognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations during the first quarter of 2020. The income tax effect of the sale was not\nmaterial. The divestiture of Uber Eats India did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and\ntherefore does not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes.\n      Divestiture of JUMP and Investment in Lime\n      On May 7, 2020, we entered into a series of transactions and agreements with Lime to divest our JUMP business (the \u201cJUMP Divestiture\u201d). Neutron Holdings,\nInc. (\u201cLime\u201d) is incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-term access use by\nconsumers for personal transportation. We previously held Lime Series C preferred stock and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series C-1 preferred stock.\n      Uber contributed hardware, equipment, intellectual property rights, technology, licensed technology, and permits of our JUMP business (collectively, \u201cJUMP\nAssets\u201d) in certain markets to Lime. JUMP Assets and previously held investments and warrants in Lime were exchanged for common stock (the \u201cLime Common\nStock\u201d), newly issued Lime Series 1-C preferred stock (\u201cLime 1-C Preferred Stock\u201d) and fully vested warrants to purchase Lime Series 1-C Preferred Stock\n(\u201cLime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants\u201d). Lime Common Stock represents approximately 10% of fully-diluted (22% undiluted) ownership interest in Lime as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n      Concurrently, we contributed $85 million of cash to Lime in exchange for a secured note convertible into Lime Series 3 Preferred Stock (the \u201cLime\nConvertible Note\u201d), which may be converted at any time at our election representing 20% initial ownership in Lime as converted on a fully-diluted basis. In\naddition, we entered into a call option agreement which gives us for a two-year period beginning May 7, 2022 the right to acquire all of the outstanding equity\ninterests of Lime held by its shareholders at fair value on the date of exercise, subject to regulatory approval. We have one seat on Lime\u2019s five-person board of\ndirectors. We also amended our preexisting commercial agreement with Lime.\n      Our ownership in Lime is comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note\n(collectively, the \u201c2020 Lime Investments\u201d) and represents approximately 31% on an as converted and fully-diluted basis as of December 31, 2021.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n     We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we\nfile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule\n13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n     Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n     There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected,\nor are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n     Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\n     Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our\nmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\n     Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n     Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nExchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\n\u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on that\nassessment,      our   management        has   concluded      that   our   internal    control    over   financial    reporting     was    effective    as   of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2021. You can find the full text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n     In accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over\nfinancial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the\ninternal control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), which we acquired in October 2021 and Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d), which we acquired in\nNovember 2021, as discussed in Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We have included the financial results of\nthese in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and total revenues related to\nDrizly and Transplace that were excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting collectively represented approximately 3% and 4% of\nour consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.\nITEM 9B.

Bank to\nenable the applicable Issuing Bank to verify the beneficiary\u2019s identity or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, including,\nwithout limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act or as otherwise customarily requested by the applicable Issuing Bank and shall specify the\ncurrency of such Letter of Credit.Upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth inSection 4.02and

Payments.In determining whether to honor\nany drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary(ies) thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which\nappear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole\ndiscretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or\ninformation to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with\nthe terms of such Letter of Credit.As between the Borrower, the Applicable Account Party and the applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower\nand the Applicable Account Party assume all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit issued by the applicable\nIssuing Bank, by the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit;provided, however,the foregoing does not limit any of the Borrower\u2019s\nor the Applicable Account Party\u2019s rights against any such beneficiary.In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, an Issuing Bank\nshall not be responsible or have any liability for: (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document\nsubmitted by any party in connection with the application for and issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in\nany or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or\nassigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in\npart, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit to comply fully\nwith any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or\ndelivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of\ntechnical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such\nLetter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by any beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any\ndrawing under such Letter of Credit; (viii) for any other action or inaction taken or suffered by such Issuing Bank under or in connection with\nany such Letter of Credit, if required or permitted under any applicable domestic or foreign law of letter of credit practice; or (ix) any\n\n\n

because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender or such Issuing Bank\nfailed to notify Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax\nineffective or for any other reason, or if Administrative Agent reasonably determines that a payment was made to a Lender or an Issuing\nBank pursuant to this Agreement without deduction of applicable withholding Tax from such payment, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as\nthe case may be, shall indemnify Administrative Agent
